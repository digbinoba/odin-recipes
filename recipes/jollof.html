<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Jollof, or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically
  made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a
  single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across
  different regions.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rice</li>
  <li>Red Onion</li>
  <li>Plum tomatoes</li>
  <li>Bell Peppers</li>
  <li>Scotch Bonner</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Bay Leaves</li>
  <li>Curry powder</li>
  <li>Thyme</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>tomato paste</li>
  <li>White pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    In a blender jar, combine tomatoes, red pepper, onion, Scotch bonnet or
    habanero, and stock. Blend until a smooth puree forms, about 2 minutes. This
    will yield just shy of 5 cups (1.18L)
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the stew base to a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, cover partially
    with a lid to contain splatter, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
    Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom
    occasionally, until reduced by half (roughly about 2 1/2 cups; 590ml), about
    30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over
    medium heat until shimmering. Add half the sliced onion along with the bay
    leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, a large pinch of salt, and a large pinch
    of black or white pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fragrant and
    the onions soften slightly, about 3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in tomato paste and 2 teaspoons (8g) butter. Cook, stirring
    continuously, until the tomato paste darkens, about 3 minutes. Stir in
    reserved stew base, cover partially with the lid to prevent splattering, and
    cook at a gentle simmer over medium-low heat until reduced by half, about 15
    minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and
    pepper; if the curry flavor is lacking, you can add more to taste (the curry
    powder should come through pleasantly but not be overpowering, though this
    is a question of personal taste).
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in rice until evenly coated in sauce. Cover the pot with a double piece
    of foil or parchment paper, crimped down around the edges to seal, then top
    with lid (this will trap steam to lock in the flavor and aid cooking).
    Reduce the heat to the lowest possible and cook for 20 minutes, then uncover
    pot and gently stir rice to redistribute. Cover again and continue to cook
    until rice is just cooked through but still retains a firm bite and the
    liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes longer. If rice is undercooked
    and/or still wet, cover and cook 5 minutes longer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in sliced tomato along with the remaining sliced onion and the
    remaining 1 teaspoon (4g) butter until butter is fully melted.
  </li>
  <li>Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Serve.</li>
