<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 pounds Chicken leg quarters</li>
  <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
  <li>½ medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
  <li>1 habanero or scotch bonnet pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
  <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
  <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoon brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon ground allspice</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
  <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Combine all marinade ingredients except the oil in a food processor and
    blend for 10 to 15 seconds. Continue blending for another 10 seconds and
    slowly pour in the oil through the feed tube until a smooth, loose paste
    forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the chicken to a large resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over
    top, then seal the bag. Toss until the chicken is well coated and
    refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clean and oil your grill grates, then set up for two zone cooking. Place the
    chicken on the cooler side of the grill and close the lid. Cook for around
    15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the chicken to the hot side of the grill and cook for another 10 to 15
    minutes, flipping occasionally, until the chicken reaches an internal
    temperature of 165ºF. Allow the chicken to cool for 5 minutes before
    serving.
